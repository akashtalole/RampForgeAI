# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RampForgeAI platform is experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) violations that prevent the frontend from connecting to the backend API. This critical infrastructure issue blocks all API communication, making the platform non-functional. The fix requires proper CSP configuration, CORS setup, and API connectivity validation to ensure seamless frontend-backend communication in both development and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Security Policy Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to successfully connect to the backend API so that the platform can function without CSP violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests to localhost:8000 THEN the CSP SHALL allow these connections without violations
2. WHEN CSP headers are configured THEN the system SHALL permit connect-src to include the backend URL
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the CSP SHALL not block any legitimate API communications
4. IF CSP violations occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
5. WHEN CSP is configured THEN the system SHALL maintain security while allowing necessary connections

### Requirement 2: CORS Configuration and Backend Setup

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to make cross-origin requests to the backend so that API calls work correctly across different ports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL configure CORS to allow requests from localhost:3000
2. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers in responses
3. WHEN preflight requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle OPTIONS requests correctly
4. IF CORS errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages
5. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL allow all necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Requirement 3: API Client Configuration and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want reliable API client functionality so that all HTTP requests work consistently with proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL use the correct base URL configuration
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL properly include JWT tokens in requests
4. IF API responses fail THEN the system SHALL handle different error types appropriately
5. WHEN API client is used THEN the system SHALL support all CRUD operations reliably

### Requirement 4: Development Environment Connectivity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless connectivity between frontend and backend in the development environment so that I can test features without infrastructure issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both services are running THEN the system SHALL establish successful connections immediately
2. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL return successful responses within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the development environment starts THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity automatically
4. IF connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN services restart THEN the system SHALL re-establish connections without manual intervention

### Requirement 5: Production-Ready Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure but functional CSP and CORS configurations so that the platform works in production while maintaining security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed to production THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific API URLs
2. WHEN CSP is applied THEN the system SHALL block malicious content while allowing legitimate requests
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL restrict origins to authorized domains only
4. IF security policies are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain functionality across environments
5. WHEN security headers are set THEN the system SHALL include all necessary protection headers
