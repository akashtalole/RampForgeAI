# Fix for Infinite API Calls Issue (Dashboard)

## Problem
The dashboard page was making continuous `/verify` and `/me` API calls in an infinite loop, causing performance issues and unnecessary server load.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Duplicate Authentication Logic**: Both `AuthProvider` and `ProtectedRoute` were making independent API calls for authentication, causing double the requests.

2. **AuthProvider useEffect Issue**: The AuthProvider had complex initialization logic that could cause multiple API calls.

3. **Mixed API URLs**: The frontend was making calls to both direct backend URLs (`http://localhost:8000`) and proxied URLs through Next.js.

4. **Inefficient checkAuthStatus**: The method was making both `/verify` and `/me` calls unnecessarily.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed ProtectedRoute.tsx
- **MAJOR CHANGE**: Removed duplicate API calls from ProtectedRoute
- Now uses `useAuth()` context instead of making its own `verifyToken()` and `getCurrentUser()` calls
- Eliminates duplicate authentication logic
- Relies on AuthProvider for all authentication state

### 2. Optimized AuthProvider.tsx
- Simplified initialization logic to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Better handling of cached user data vs fresh API calls
- Improved token validation flow
- Split useEffect for better dependency management

### 3. Simplified AuthService.checkAuthStatus()
- Removed complex logic that made multiple API calls
- Now only does simple token validation
- Lets the caller handle user data fetching

### 4. Standardized API URLs
Updated all frontend components to use Next.js API proxy:
- `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts` - Changed API_BASE to use proxy
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Changed API_BASE to use proxy  
- `frontend/src/app/test-api/page.tsx` - Updated fetch calls to use `/api/*`
- `frontend/src/components/HealthCheck.tsx` - Updated to use `/api/health`
- `frontend/src/components/mcp/MCPServiceList.tsx` - Updated all API calls

## Key Improvements

### Before (Problematic Flow):
1. AuthProvider initializes → calls `checkAuthStatus()` → calls `/verify` + potentially `/me`
2. ProtectedRoute mounts → calls `verifyToken()` → calls `/verify`  
3. ProtectedRoute → calls `getCurrentUser()` → calls `/me`
4. **Result**: Multiple redundant API calls on every page load

### After (Optimized Flow):
1. AuthProvider initializes → checks cached user → calls `/verify` OR `/me` (not both)
2. ProtectedRoute uses AuthProvider context → **NO additional API calls**
3. **Result**: Minimal, efficient API calls

## Testing
Updated `test-verify-fix.js` to monitor both `/verify` and `/me` calls:
```bash
node test-verify-fix.js
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001` in `.env.local` to use the monitoring proxy.

## Expected Results
- **Dashboard page load**: Should see 1-2 API calls total (either `/verify` or `/me`, not both repeatedly)
- **Token validation**: Every 10 minutes when user is logged in
- **Health checks**: Every 30 seconds (normal behavior)
- **No infinite loops**: API calls should be predictable and minimal

## Verification Steps
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the monitoring script: `node test-verify-fix.js`
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001` in frontend `.env.local`
4. Start the frontend development server
5. Navigate to `/dashboard`
6. Monitor the console output - should see minimal API calls
7. Check browser Network tab for confirmation

## Benefits
- **Performance**: Eliminated redundant API calls
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for authentication state
- **Maintainability**: Simplified authentication flow
- **User Experience**: Faster page loads, no unnecessary network requests
