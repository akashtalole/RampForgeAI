## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- SQLite database suitable for development only
- Limited to single-instance deployment
- No real-time notifications system yet
- Basic error handling in some edge cases

### Workarounds
- Use Docker Compose for consistent development environment
- Monitor logs for debugging integration issues
- Implement client-side polling for real-time updates
- Use health check endpoints for service monitoring
